# Implementation Roadmap

> Part of [AI SDLC Orchestrator](../overview.md) specification

---

## Phase 1a — Core Skeleton + Temporal (1 week)

- Nx monorepo: `orchestrator-api`, `orchestrator-worker`, `workflow-dsl`, `common/*`, `db`
- NestJS + Fastify bootstrap with healthcheck endpoints (`/health/live`, `/health/ready`)
- `AiAgentPort` interface — single `invoke()` method (the only port in the system)
- `libs/common/temporal/` — Temporal client factory, Worker factory, interceptors
- Docker Compose: app PostgreSQL + PgBouncer + Temporal auto-setup (server + UI + Elasticsearch for visibility) + agent Docker container for local dev fallback
- Worker validates full Temporal stack with no-op Workflow + Activity
- MikroORM entities + migrations: `Tenant`, `TenantMcpServer`, `TenantVcsCredential`, `TenantRepoConfig`, `WebhookDelivery`, `WorkflowMirror`, `WorkflowEvent`, `AgentSession`, `AgentToolCall`, `WorkflowDsl`
- `updateWorkflowMirror` Activity — writes state transitions to app DB
- `Result<T, E>` error handling setup
- Dev tooling: CLAUDE.md, MCP config, Pino → Loki pipeline
- Temporal namespace creation automation (one per tenant)

## Phase 1b — DSL Compiler + Sandbox (1 week)

> **Risk note:** The DSL compiler is the most complex component in the system — compiling typed YAML to deterministic Temporal Workflow code with version pinning, `patched()` hotfixes, and replay safety. This deserves a dedicated week, not a sub-item of Phase 1.

- Workflow DSL schema (Zod) + compiler (YAML → Temporal Workflow registration). Handle `signal_wait` type separately from `auto` (compiles to `condition()`, not `executeActivity()`)
- DSL version pinning: Workflow records `dslName + dslVersion` at start, replays use pinned version
- DSL compiler tests: validate every step type (`auto`, `signal_wait`, `gate`, `loop`, `terminal`) compiles to valid Temporal Workflow code. Test replay determinism with version changes
- **Agent sandbox setup:** Install Kata Containers runtime on the K8s cluster (`kata-containers` RuntimeClass). Build agent OCI image from `Dockerfile.agent` with toolchain (Git, Node, Python, Go). Build credential-proxy sidecar image from `Dockerfile.credential-proxy`. Validate sandbox with a test agent session — verify KVM isolation, credential proxy sidecar (agent container cannot access mounted secrets), K8s NetworkPolicy (egress blocked)
- Agent image CI pipeline: `Dockerfile.agent` change → build image → push to container registry → smoke test
- Docker fallback mode for local dev: `SANDBOX_MODE=docker` runs agent in local Docker container

## Phase 2 — Webhook Handlers + Agent Integration (1–2 weeks)

- Thin webhook handlers: Jira, GitLab, GitHub, Linear (~50 lines each: verify signature, extract event, normalize)
- Webhook deduplication: delivery ID extraction + `WEBHOOK_DELIVERY` table persistence
- **Tenant CRUD API** — `POST/GET/PUT /tenants` + nested CRUD for MCP servers, VCS credentials, repo configs. Zod-validated. CLI seed script for initial tenant setup
- **Dashboard auth:** OIDC integration (Google/GitHub), API key generation per tenant, RBAC (admin/operator/viewer)
- Claude Code integration via `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` — implements `AiAgentPort.invoke()`
- `invokeAgent` Activity: create Kata pod via K8s API → wait for Ready → clone repo → setup → build prompt → pass MCP servers → start agent session → heartbeat → collect `AgentResult` (including `toolCalls` for `AGENT_TOOL_CALL` table) → verify agent output (branch exists, MR exists) → delete pod
- Agent output verification: `git ls-remote` for branch, VCS API call for MR existence after agent reports success
- Differentiated retry strategy: retry on infra errors (pod OOM, scheduling failure). No retry on agent logic errors / cost limit / turn limit (`ApplicationFailure` with `nonRetryable: true`)
- Agent MCP pass-through: query `TENANT_MCP_SERVER` → build MCP config → pass to Agent SDK
- **Budget reservation:** reserve per-task cost cap from tenant's monthly budget at workflow start. Release surplus on completion. Reject new workflows when budget exhausted
- **Per-repo concurrency:** workflow ID = `{tenant}-{provider}-{taskId}`, but check `TENANT_REPO_CONFIG.max_concurrent_workflows` before starting. Queue excess workflows
- Graceful agent shutdown: SIGTERM at T-5min, 2-min grace period
- `cleanupBranch` Activity: delete remote branch + close draft MR when workflow reaches BLOCKED
- E2E single-repo: task webhook → Temporal Workflow → agent creates branch + code + MR → visible in Temporal UI

## Phase 3 — CI/Review Feedback Loops + Multi-Repo (1 week)

- CI webhook handlers → signal running Workflow (`pipelineFailed` / `pipelineSucceeded`)
- Review webhook handlers → signal (`changesRequested`)
- `ci_watch` step compiled as Workflow-level `condition()` wait (not an Activity) with 2h timeout
- `ci_fix_loop`: fresh `invoke()` call with `mode: ci_fix` — agent receives `previousSessionSummary`, checks out existing branch, fetches CI logs via MCP, fixes, pushes
- `review_fix_loop`: fresh `invoke()` call with `mode: review_fix` — same pattern with review comments
- Multi-repo: parent Temporal Workflow spawns child workflow executions. Configurable failure strategy (`wait_all` / `fail_fast`)
- E2E: red pipeline → agent fix loop → green pipeline → review → done

## Phase 4 — Gate UI + Cost Dashboard (1 week)

- Gate approval: `POST /workflows/:id/gates/:gateId/approve` → `gateApproved` signal (authenticated, RBAC-checked)
- Minimal dashboard:
  - Tenant config screens (MCP servers, VCS credentials, repo configs — from normalized tables)
  - Gate approval UI (workflows waiting for approval)
  - Cost dashboard from app DB (reserved vs actual, per-task breakdown)
  - Agent session viewer: tool calls timeline from `AGENT_TOOL_CALL` table
- Temporal UI remains primary visibility tool — link from dashboard per workflow
- Prometheus + Grafana dashboards: throughput, success rate, cost/task, Kata pod metrics
- Webhook delivery log viewer (from `WEBHOOK_DELIVERY` table)

## Phase 5 — Full Custom Dashboard (1–2 weeks)

- Workflow list: all workflows with status badges, filters — from `workflow_mirror` via Elasticsearch-backed Temporal queries
- Workflow detail: timeline from `workflow_event`, agent session panel (tool calls, summary), cost breakdown, link to Temporal UI
- SSE endpoint: real-time state updates tailing `workflow_event`
- Alerts on cost spikes, stuck workflows, failure rates, pod OOM kills
- Periodic reconciliation dashboard: stale mirrors, orphaned cost reservations

## Phase 6 — DSL Visual Editor (future)

- React Flow-based editor for workflow YAML DSL
- Drag-and-drop steps, gate condition editor, loop config
- Real-time Zod validation via `@ai-orchestrator/workflow-dsl`
- Per-tenant versioning and rollback

## Phase 7 — Cross-Platform Expansion (future)

- YouTrack, ClickUp webhook handlers + MCP server configs
- Bitbucket webhook handler + MCP server config
- OpenHands agent support via `AiAgentPort`
- Tenant onboarding wizard (self-service), team management, audit log viewer

## Open Questions

### Resolved

| Question | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **MikroORM vs Prisma** | **MikroORM** | Unit of Work, explicit transactions, better for Activity-level DB control where you need to confirm DB write before marking Activity complete |
| **Temporal DB: shared or dedicated PostgreSQL?** | **Dedicated** | Separate instance for isolation, independent scaling, simpler DR. SaaS with many tenants needs this |
| **Agent container isolation** | **Kata Containers** | K8s-native microVM runtime. Hardware-level KVM isolation per pod. CNCF project, Apache-2.0. Standard K8s primitives (NetworkPolicy, Secrets, resource limits). No separate infrastructure — runs as a RuntimeClass in the cluster |
| **Agent reliability for MR creation** | **`cleanupBranch` Activity** | When workflow reaches BLOCKED, a cleanup Activity deletes the remote branch and closes any draft MR. Prevents orphaned resources |
| **`resumeSession` semantics** | **No resume — fresh sessions** | Each invocation (implement, ci_fix, review_fix) is a fresh agent session. Previous session's `summary` + existing branch state provides continuity. No conversation history persistence needed |
| **Credential proxy isolation** | **Multi-container pod model** | Agent container and credential-proxy sidecar run in the same Kata pod. K8s provides filesystem and process isolation between containers natively. No uid/hidepid workarounds needed |
| **Agent output trust** | **Server-side verification** | Activity verifies branch existence (`git ls-remote`) and MR existence (VCS API) after agent reports success. Prevents silent failures from hallucinating agents |
| **Retry strategy** | **Error-type differentiation** | Retry on infra errors (pod OOM, scheduling failure). No retry on agent logic errors, cost limit, turn limit. `ApplicationFailure` with `nonRetryable: true` |
| **Local dev sandbox** | **Docker fallback mode** | `SANDBOX_MODE=docker` runs agent in local Docker container. Same setup sequence, weaker isolation. Never used in production (enforced by config validation) |
| **DSL compiler timeline** | **Dedicated Phase 1b (1 week)** | DSL compiler is the most complex component — version pinning, replay determinism, `patched()` hotfixes. Deserves dedicated week, not a sub-item |

### Open

| Question | Context | Decision Needed By |
|---|---|---|
| **Gate approval UX: dashboard vs tracker comment** | Dashboard UI (explicit, traceable) vs reply to Jira/GitLab comment (easier for reviewers in the tracker). Both can coexist — comment triggers webhook, dashboard is fallback | Phase 4 start |
| **MCP server scoping per tenant** | Platform MCP servers give agent full access to the tenant's project. Need to verify each MCP server supports project/repo-level scoping to prevent cross-tenant data access via agent. Consider MCP server allowlisting (curated list of verified servers) vs open (tenant adds any server) | Phase 2 start |
| **Elasticsearch vs OpenSearch for Temporal visibility** | Both supported by Temporal. Elasticsearch is the default. OpenSearch is fully open-source (no licensing concerns). For self-hosted SaaS, OpenSearch may be preferable | Phase 1a start |
| **Agent conversation log storage** | `AGENT_TOOL_CALL` captures tool calls, but full conversation logs (reasoning, intermediate thoughts) could be valuable for debugging. Storage cost vs debugging value. Consider: store full logs in object storage (S3/GCS), reference from `AGENT_SESSION`, 30-day retention | Phase 2 |
| **Multi-repo review gate UX** | Parent workflow has N child MRs. Does the reviewer approve each MR individually (N approvals) or approve the parent workflow (1 approval, auto-merges all)? Former is safer but slower | Phase 3 |
| **Kata warm pod pool** | Cold pod creation with Kata adds 150-300ms VM startup + image pull time. For faster agent spawn, consider maintaining a pool of pre-created warm pods that are claimed per session instead of created from scratch. Trade-off: resource cost of idle pods vs latency improvement | Phase 2 |
| **Kata + containerd configuration** | Kata Containers requires specific containerd configuration and kernel support (KVM). Need to validate target K8s distribution supports Kata RuntimeClass installation and document the setup procedure | Phase 1b — validate during sandbox setup |
| **Pod scheduling strategy for agent workloads** | Agent pods are CPU/memory-intensive (4-8 GB RAM). Need dedicated node pool with appropriate instance types? Or mixed scheduling with priority classes? Consider node affinity/taints to isolate agent workloads from system pods | Phase 1b |
| **Agent model routing per task complexity** | Default cost cap $5/task. Simple tasks (typo fix) cost ~$0.50 with Opus, could use Haiku/Sonnet for 5-10x savings. Complex tasks (refactor auth module) may need $20-50. No mechanism to estimate complexity or select model. Consider: task label-based model selection, or let agent start with cheap model and escalate | v2 |
| **Pod backpressure** | If 50 workflows start simultaneously, 50 pod creation calls hit K8s API. Temporal's `maxConcurrentActivityTaskExecutions` limits per-worker, but cluster-wide surge needs capacity planning or admission control. Consider K8s ResourceQuota per tenant namespace | Phase 2 |
